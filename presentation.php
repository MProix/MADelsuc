My activity is mostly oriented toward the use and improvement of spectroscopies, in particular
NMR and more recently FT-MS. This includes new experiment design, development of data processing
methods, development of software programs. I have been deeply involved in field as diverse as
protein structural analysis, protein-ligand screening, complex mixture analysis, quantum mechanic
details of the NMR phenomenon, automatic data analysis, fractal dimension of proteins and
polymers, etc.
</p><p>
I started my career in 1980 with the rise of multidimensional NMR, and was deeply involved with
the early theoretical and experimental aspects of 2D NMR. I defended my thesis in 1985 in
Paris-Orsay, under the supervision of Jean-Yves Lallemand.
After 10 years in the Institut de Chimie des Substance Naturelles (Gif-sur-Yvette) I moved in 1993
to Centre de Biochimie Structurale (Montpellier) where I got more involved in the application of
NMR to biological systems, in particular proteins.
I moved in 2008 to the Institut de Génétique, Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in
Strasbourg, and started an exciting new project on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP). This
special state of the biological matter has been largely ignored or even denied, but recently it
was acknowledged that probably one third of the proteins of a superior organism are in this IDP
state. Of course, these IDP proteins do not crystalize, and the study must be performed in
solution. In consequence, NMR, but also ESI-MS, SAXS, DLS, CD and all other solution methods are
used.
</p><p>
Experimental developments have been a constant concern in my carrier. One can note for instance
 in my bibliography: water NMR signal suppression (<em>JACS</em> 1984), oversampling in NMR
 acquisition (<em>JMR</em> 1986), hypercomplex formalisation of 2D NMR (<em>JMR</em> 1988), optimisation of 3D NMR
 (<em>JMR</em> 1991) NMR processing software (<em>J Biomol NMR</em> 1996, <em>Bioinformatics</em> 1998, <em>JMR</em> 2007), use of
 Maximum Entropy in data analysis (1D-NMR <em>JMR</em> 1989, NUS 2D-NMR, <em>Cr Acad Chim</em> 2006, for DOSY: <em>Anal
 Chem</em> 1998, for SAXS: <em>Chem Mater</em> 2007), quantitative PCR for T-Cell repertoire analysis (<em>J Immunol</em>
 2001, 2 patents), fractal dimension analysis of polymers and proteins (<em>J Phys Chem B </em>2009, JMR
 2011), 2D FT-ICR MS (<em>Anal Chem</em> 2012), FT-ICR denoising (<em>PNAS </em>2014, one patent).
 </p><p>
 All these development have always been with the purpose of widening the application field, improving the quality, or speeding up the various methods involved. This has always been motivated by genuine analytical and biological problems: protein structures, interaction with other biological or chemical partners, understanding of the dynamics of complex mixtures.
 </p><p>
 During my entire carrier I has been eager to transfer the academic knowledge and skills from
 the academic to a broader audience. I received several prices in this respect (IBM 1992, Acad.
 Science 1993, Ministère Industrie 2000) and supervised 5 PhD thesis funded by the industry. I
 developed several programs distributed and/or sold world-wide for the processing and analysis of
 scientific data. In 2000, I funded the NMRTEC Company, dedicated to this transfer from the
 academic world to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. I remained CSO of NMRTEC until
 recently. In 2014 I co-funded CASC4DE with the aim of extending the use of innovative processing
 techniques, built from the advances in BigData analysis and Compressed Sensing approaches, to the
 field of biophysics.

<p>Working on the fractal dimension of proteins, I used the image of spaghetti cooking to explain what is the fractal dimension, and how it can be used to 
describe the state of the proteins.
This explaination Cattracted some interest, so I decided to make a small presentation <a href="Spa/spaghetti.html"><b>here</b></a>.
