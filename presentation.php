        <h1>Main Scientific Interests</h1>
        <p>
            My activity is mostly oriented toward the use and improvement of spectroscopies, in particular NMR and more recently FT-MS. This includes new experiment design, development of data processing methods, development of software programs. I have been deeply involved in field as diverse as protein structural analysis, protein-ligand screening, complex mixture analysis, quantum mechanic details of the NMR phenomenon, automatic data analysis, fractal dimension of proteins and polymers, etc.

            I started my career in 1980 with the rise of multidimensional NMR, and was deeply involved with the early theoretical and experimental aspects of 2D NMR. I defended my thesis in 1985 in Paris-Orsay, under the supervision of Jean-Yves Lallemand. After 10 years in the Institut de Chimie des Substance Naturelles (Gif-sur-Yvette) I moved in 1993 to Centre de Biochimie Structurale (Montpellier) where I got more involved in the application of NMR to biological systems, in particular proteins. I moved in 2008 to the Institut de Génétique, Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in Strasbourg, and started an exciting new project on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP). This special state of the biological matter has been largely ignored or even denied, but recently it was acknowledged that probably one third of the proteins of a superior organism are in this IDP state. Of course, these IDP proteins do not crystalize, and the study must be performed in solution. In consequence, NMR, but also ESI-MS, SAXS, DLS, CD and all other solution methods are used.

            Experimental developments have been a constant concern in my carrier. One can note for instance  in my bibliography: water NMR signal suppression (<span class="italic">JACS</span> 1984), oversampling in NMR  acquisition (<span class="italic">JMR</span> 1986), hypercomplex formalisation of 2D NMR (<span class="italic">JMR</span> 1988), optimisation of 3D NMR  (<span class="italic">JMR</span> 1991) NMR processing software (<span class="italic">J Biomol NMR</span> 1996, <span class="italic">Bioinformatics</span> 1998, <span class="italic">JMR</span> 2007), use of  Maximum Entropy in data analysis (1D-NMR <span class="italic">JMR</span> 1989, NUS 2D-NMR, <span class="italic">Cr Acad Chim</span> 2006, for DOSY: <span class="italic">Anal Chem</span> 1998, for SAXS: <span class="italic">Chem Mater</span> 2007), quantitative PCR for T-Cell repertoire analysis (<span class="italic">J Immunol</span>  2001, 2 patents), fractal dimension analysis of polymers and proteins (<span class="italic">J Phys Chem B </span>2009, JMR  2011), 2D FT-ICR MS (<span class="italic">Anal Chem</span> 2012), FT-ICR denoising (<span class="italic">PNAS </span>2014, one patent).
        </p>
        <p>
            All these development have always been with the purpose of widening the application field, improving the quality, or speeding up the various methods involved. This has always been motivated by genuine analytical and biological problems: protein structures, interaction with other biological or chemical partners, understanding of the dynamics of complex mixtures.

            During my entire carrier I has been eager to transfer the academic knowledge and skills from the academic to a broader audience. I received several prices in this respect (IBM 1992, Acad. Science 1993, Ministère Industrie 2000) and supervised 5 PhD thesis funded by the industry. I developed several programs distributed and/or sold world-wide for the processing and analysis of  scientific data. In 2000, I funded the NMRTEC Company, dedicated to this transfer from the academic world to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. I remained CSO of NMRTEC until recently. In 2014 I co-funded CASC4DE with the aim of extending the use of innovative processing techniques, built from the advances in BigData analysis and Compressed Sensing approaches, to the  field of biophysics.

                Working on the fractal dimension of proteins, I used the image of spaghetti cooking to explain what is the fractal dimension, and how it can be used to describe the state of the proteins. This explaination Cattracted some interest, so I decided to make a small presentation <span class="spaghettis">here.</span>
